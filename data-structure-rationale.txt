In a makefile, targets specify their dependencies. It is never the case where a
dependency will say that it is needed by a target. Translating this to parents
and children in a tree, parents always decide who their children are, and
children never decide who their parents are. Therefore, the only methods that
should be exposed to the user dealing with the tree will be ones that don't add
parents to a child.
