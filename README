To The Team:
	Hello Team Prancing Koala. I have set up this git repository in my
	personal github account. I think if we get this set up early, it will
	be very beneficial to our project, and save us a lot of time and stress
	down the road.  I know that you had a github account as well, Soren, so
	you know the drill for using a git repository. For Kalpit, it is pretty
	simple to get started, and I'm sure you'll catch on fast. Maybe we can
	just meet for half an hour this weekend, and Soren or I can show you
	the basics (basically it just makes it so we can all work on the same
	directory on different machines, with some other features to make it so
	we don't step on each others toes)!

	This is a new function.
	I'm editing this funciton...or am I?
