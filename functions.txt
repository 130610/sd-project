FUNCTION IDEAS CONTRIBUTED BY SOREN
===================================

parseMakefile()
  This function reads in a Makefile and stores its dependency chain and any
  other information that we may use for building the level and stores it in some
  sort of internal representation.

mainMenu()
  This function draws the main menu and, depending on the user's selection, can
  start the Makefile parser and game screen, customization screen, or quit
  screen.

Quitting
--------

quitTest()
  This function initiates the quitting procedure, which is used to determine
  the user's fitness for leaving the game. This function performs the following
  tasks:
    - Draw the quit screen.
    - Activate quitButtonMove(), the first test.
    - Activate quitDateTest(), the second test.
    - Run terminate(), which quits the program.
  If the user cancels during either of the tests, return to the main menu rather
  than quitting.

quitButtonMove()
  This function moves the quit button across the quit screen on a timer, to make
  it harder for the user to quit the game. If the quit button reaches the edge
  of the screen, turn around and send it back in the opposite direction. If the
  user clicks on the quit button, return back to quitTest.

quitDateTest()
  This function makes the user input the correct day that the provided date
  falls on in order to continue quitting the program. It runs randomDate() to
  find a date (returning some sort of date object, probably), then asks the user
  for the answer, then runs getDay() to determine if the entry is correct and
  the user can be allowed to continue the quit procedure.

randomDate()
  This function picks a random date from eligible ones (defined by some
  configuration) and returns it to be displayed to the user.

getDay()
  This function determines the day that the date selected by randomDate() fell
  on (in order to determine if the user is correct).

terminate()
  This function performs any necessary cleanup before terminating the program
  (closing files, saving anything that can be saved, etc.). Then it quits the
  program.
